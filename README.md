# interform

Design patterns and visual quality for Claude Code.

## What This Does

A single skill that provides design guidance across web, TUI, native, and print mediums. The goal is production-grade interfaces that look intentional rather than the default "an AI generated this and nobody reviewed it" aesthetic.

Anti-AI-slop is the operating principle. Bold choices over safe defaults, distinctive over generic, considered over templated.

## Installation

```bash
/plugin install interform
```

## Usage

```
"design a dashboard layout for this monitoring tool"
"make this TUI look more polished"
"review the visual design of this interface"
```

Or invoke directly:

```
/interform:distinctive-design
```
